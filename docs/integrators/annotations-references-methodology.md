# Annotation Methodology

::: warning
This page is still under development.
:::

::: info Notes and References
Annotation references are written in the following format: `[^1]`, `[^2]`, `[^3]`, etc. and are used to link to a note or reference.
:::

::: info Identifiers
Prefer whole numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.) to link to a note or reference. Avoid roman numbers, letters, or other symbols.
:::

::: info Multiple annotations
Separate your annotation references with a comma and a space (e.g. `[^1], [^2], [^3]`, etc.) when multiple annotations are grouped together.
