# SVG Methodology



:::info Floating text boxes warning
Before saving as an SVG from Word, make sure no part of the chart is floating outside of the chart area. If this is the case, the floating text boxes will be lost when saving as an SVG. This is a known issue with Word. To fix this, contact the analyst and request that they add the text box to the chart in Excel before importing it into Word.
