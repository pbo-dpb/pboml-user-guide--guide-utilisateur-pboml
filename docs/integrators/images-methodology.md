# Images Methodology



:::info Prefer SVG images
SVG images are preferred over bitmap images. SVG images are vector-based and will scale to any size without losing quality. Bitmap images (such as JPEG, PNGs and WebP) will lose quality when scaled up and be blurry when scaled down.

:::info Avoid unnecessary images
Images should only be used when they are necessary to convey information. Images should not be used for decorative purposes.

:::info Upload bitmaps to 99Bank
Bitmap slice images should be uploaded to 99Bank. This will ensure that the images are available to all users in the appropriate format and size. 99Bank's distribution network will also ensure that the images are served quickly to users.
