# Add structure to your document

As mentionned in the `[structure your document](LINK)` section, the editor represents your documents as an ordered sequence of _slices_. So in order to structure your document, the editor allows you to do many things on your _slices_. More specificaly, the actions you can do on a slice are the following: adding, deleting, duplicating, moving, and visualising.

## Add a slice

Adding a new slice is very simple:

1.  Go to the bottom of the editor
2.  Click on the type of slice you want to add
3.  You should see a slice editing area with the text fields relevant to that slice

    `[Insert Add a new slice section]`

## Delete a slice

1.  On the visual editor, scroll to the slice you want to delete
2.  Once you find that slice, click on the delete button
  `[insert delete button red trash can]`

  `[Insert picture of alert]`

2.  Once you find that slice, click on the duplicate button
  `[insert Duplicate button]`

## Move a slice

1.  On the visual editor, scroll to the slice you want to move
2.  If you want to move your slice towards the top of the document, click `[up]`; if you want to move your slice towards the end of the document, click `[down]`
