# Preview & Save

Before saving your document, we recommend you preview it using the editor's built-in preview option.

## Preview your document

There are two preview options:

-	Preview as Raw PBOML
-	Preview final Document

If you click on the `[Preview as Raw PBOML]` button you will be able to see the machine code representation of the document, however, as mentioned in the `[Getting Started](LINK)` section, we wonâ€™t focus on that.

If you click on the `[Preview final Document](LINK)` button, you will be able to see how your document will look like once you click save.

## Save your document

Before saving, you must be sure that the document is well edited and ready for review. The moment you click the save button, the edited document will be immediately published to the public. The save button is located at the bottom of the editor:
