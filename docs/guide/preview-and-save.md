## Preview your document

There are two preview options:

-	Preview as Raw PBOML
-	Preview final Document

If you click on the *Preview as Raw PBOML* button you will be able to see the machine code representation of the document, however, as mentioned in the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md), we wonâ€™t focus on that.

If you click on the *Preview final Document* button, you will be able to see how your document will look once rendered.

## Save your document

:::warning
Before saving, **you must be sure that the document is well edited and ready for review**.
:::

When you click on *Save*, the publication won't be directly published. Its only when the 
*Is publishable* is checked, that your changes will be immediately applied to the current document and the edited document will published to the public.
