# Headings

There are three ways you can add a heading to your document: with a heading slice, inside a slice directly or within the content directly. The use of the heading slice is preferred over the one within the paragraph.

## With a Heading Slice

A **Heading Slice** is used to represent a heading inside your document.

1.  First add a title slice as explained in the `[Add a slice section]`.

  `[Show picture of empty title slice]`

2.  Choose the level for that heading.

  `[show levels selection section]`

3.  Enter the heading title content in both English and French.

  **`[Show Content pasted from word] | [Show final results]`**

## Inside a Slice directly

For all slices except the heading slice (for obvious reasons), you can add a title that will label the content of that slice.

To add a title label inside a slice directly you must first toggle to the slice you want to title.

1.  Click on the [gear button].

  `[Show result for a slice]`

2.  Enter the title in both English and French in their respective fields.

  `[Show result]`

## Within the content of the Slice

This last method to add a title is not recommended because it Visual PBOML Editor might generate an invalid table of content for the document that has title within the content of slices. To make sure you don`t make the mistake you must first understand the format of the content that is pasted from word to the editor.

Slices which have text content usually follow the markdown syntax. You can find a quick summary of that simple syntax in the [Markdown Guide]. Titles in that syntax are formatted as such:

[Show md title example]

For example, if your paragraph contained in the Markdown slice has text that follows that syntax, title will appear on the final document. And as mentioned, the table of content might not be correctly formatted. For these reasons, try to make sure you do not copy from Word any title or heading and instead opt for either of the two options: [] and [].
