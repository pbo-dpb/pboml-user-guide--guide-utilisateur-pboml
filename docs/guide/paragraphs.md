# Paragraphs

Paragraphs are added using a slice called the **Markdown Slice**.

1.  First add a Markdown slice as explained in the `[Add a slice section]`.
2.  Copy from Word the paragraphs that you want to add to your document. Donâ€™t forget to add that content in both the English and French fields.
3.  Paste it using the paste from word button and that's all.
