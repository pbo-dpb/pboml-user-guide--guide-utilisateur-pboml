# Paragraphs

Paragraphs are added using a slice called the **Markdown Slice**.

1.  First add a Markdown slice as explained in the section [*Add a slice*](./structure-your-document.html#add-a-slice).
2.  Copy from **Word** the paragraphs that you want to add to your document. Donâ€™t forget to add that content in both the English and French fields.
3.  Paste it using the *Paste from Word* button <Icon hero="clipboard-document-list"></Icon>
