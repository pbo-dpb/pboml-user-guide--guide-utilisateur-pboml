# Key-Value Lists

You might need to use a key value list to present for example your sources or the authors of a report. The PBOML Editor allows you to create key value pairs with a Key-Value List slice. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

-	First add a key-value slice as explained in the [Add a slice section]

  `[Show empty key-value slice]`

In a report, you should indicate the meaning of the keys and values: for example, variables and sources; or, name and email; etc.

- To indicate the type of information that the keys and the values contain, you first need to click on the [little gear button on the corner]

  `[Show how it looks after the gear has been pressed]`

-	Now you can add the content of your key and value in both English and French

  `[Show example]`

You can add a new key-value pair to the list by simply click on the [x] icon; and to delete, just click on the trash can on the left of the key-value pair that you want to remove [trash can].
