# Key-Value Lists

Key-value (KV) lists are the best way to present a list of variables and corresponding values. KV lists help organize and present information in a structured and easily understandable way. They are much preferable to other alternatives, such as a bullet list where part of the content would be set in a bold font or a two column table.

The PBOML Editor allows you to create key value pairs with the *Key-Value List slice*.

Here‚Äôs how to get started:

1.  First add a key-value slice as explained in the [*Add a slice*](./structure-your-document.html#add-a-slice) section

::: info
In a report, you should indicate the meaning of the keys and values: for example, variables and sources; or, name and email; etc.
:::

2.  To indicate the type of information that the keys and the values contain, you first need to click on the gear button <Icon hero="cog-6-tooth"></Icon>

3.  Now you can add the content of your key and value in both English and French

You can add a new key-value pair to the list by simply click on the ‚ûï icon; and to delete, just click on the trash üóëÔ∏è icon can on the left of the key-value pair that you want to remove.
