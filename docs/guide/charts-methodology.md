## If using a Chart Slice, the methodology for Tables also applies

## If using an SVG, before saving as an SVG from Word, make sure that the units are specified on the SVG using the tools that helped you generate your graph

## All SVG must always be titled

## Depending on the type of publication, the Chart Slice or the SVG Slice may need to have an anchor name.
