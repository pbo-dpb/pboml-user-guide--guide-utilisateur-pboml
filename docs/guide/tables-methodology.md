## If the table is copied from Word, make sure that the following is satisfied

- **No merged cells**
- **No units attached to the numerical data**
- **No references in the title of the table**
- **Only one table per table title**

## A table that holds numerical values should have its units declared in its respective variable

**If only all variables have the same unit, you only need to declare a single variable**

## Every single table must be individually titled

## Depending on the type of publication, a table may need to have an anchor name

## Variable should be rows of data of the same type
