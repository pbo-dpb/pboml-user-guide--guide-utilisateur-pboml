# Heading Methodology

::: warning
This page is still under development.
:::

## Depending on the publication type, use the appropriate heading method, either exclusively the Heading slice or exclusively the in-slice heading.

## Depending on the publication type, the in-slice heading must be hidden (please refer to the publication specific guide).

## Tables, charts, SVGs and images must always be titled using the in-slice heading.
 
## Any heading, in-slice or Heading slice, must never contain references and annotations using the PBOML syntax.

## Any heading, in-slice or Heading slice can only allow plain text content (no Markdown synthax)
