# Getting Started

## Opening the Editor

Opening the editor is simple: on the Chrome browser, simply click on the PBOML link found on the Publications page of the publication you wish to edit. Here is the publication page of a LEG with the PBOML link:

## Main Editing Area

The editor is composed of the following areas:
-	The alerts display section
-	Editor View Option
-	Editor View section

In Editor View Option, there are two editor views available, however this user guide focuses on editing using the visual editor. If you wish to learn about the structure of the PBOML Format (a subset of YAML) that is used to represent the document in a machine-readable way, you can visit the [PBOML Language Wiki](https://github.com/pbo-dpb/pboml-parser--parseur-pboml/wiki).

What you see in the editor view section is different depending on what editor view option you selected. Weâ€™ll only focus on the view when the editor option is set to [Edit using the visual editor].
