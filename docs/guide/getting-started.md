In the *Editor View Option*, there are two editor views available: *Edit raw YAML* and *Edit using the visual editor*. 

::: warning
This user guide focuses on editing using the visual editor. If you wish to learn about the structure of the PBOML Format (a subset of YAML) that is used to represent the document in a machine-readable way, you can visit the [PBOML Language Wiki](https://github.com/pbo-dpb/pboml-parser--parseur-pboml/wiki). What you see in the editor view section is different depending on what editor view option you selected. **We will only focus on the view when the editor option is set to *Edit using the visual editor***.
