# Slice descriptors

Slice descriptors are used to provide additional information about a slice. They are meant to be rendered at the bottom of a slice and complement or supplement the information provided in the slice itself.

You can add one or more entry for each type of descriptor. For example, you can add multiple sources to a slice, or multiple notes.

1.  In the editor, at the bottom of the slice, click on the descriptor type you want to add.
2.  Click on the ‚ûï sign.
3.  Fill the descriptor information in both English and French. Descriptors all accept Markdown formatting.

If you wish to delete an existing descriptor, click on the corresponding trash üóëÔ∏è button on the left.

## Textual descriptions

Textual descriptions are meant to provide a textual description of the content of a slice. They are meant to be read by screen readers and are therefore not visible by default.

Sighted users will generally not see the textual description unless they opt-in to see it by clicking on the *Textual description* button. This button is displayed at the bottom of a slice when a textual description is available. As such, avoid including information in them if that information cannot be found in the described chart, table, paragraph, etc.

Since textual descriptions are meant to be read by screen readers, they should be written in a way that is accessible to screen readers. For example, avoid using abbreviations, acronyms, or other type of shorthand that may not be understood by screen readers.

Content in textual descriptions is written in Markdown. This includes simple tables, lists, and other formatting options.

### Sources

Instead of including references or other type of attribution at the document level (e.g. through an endnote added through the *Notes & references* tab), sources can be attached directly to a slice. This practice should generally be avoided in regular reports (except for content out of the document main flow, such as for asides and figures) as it can conflict with the general structure of the document. Readers may wonder why this note is placed directly after a paragraph, while others are placed at the end of the document.

It is however good to keep this option in mind, especially when converting a Word document that could contain both endnotes and footnotes.

### Notes

In the same way as for sources, notes can be attached to a slice. The same considerations regarding document structure as for sources should apply here.
