# Annotations

The PBOML Editor allows you to add many types of annotations to any slice you have created, for example: references, textual descriptions, sources, and notes.

## Reference

There are two types of objects you can reference: theses are slices and annotations. When you reference either of them, the final publication will display a hyperlink that will send the reader to whatever you are referencing:

  `[insert picture of hyperlink reference with annotation in Final rendered result]`
  `[insert picture of hyperlink reference with a slice ID in Final rendered result]`

### Reference a Slice

To reference a slice, you first need to set a reference name for that same slice:

1.  Go to the slice you wish to reference.
2.  Click on the little [Settings Icon] located towards to upper-right corner of the slice editing area
3.  Enter whatever name in both languages by which you want to reference your slice with

Then, to reference that slice, within any other section of you document, you simply need to use the reference name inside any text field as follows:

  `[insert reference format for a slice]`

### Reference an annotation

Referencing an annotation is more common, to do so you will need to go to the `[Notes & references]` section and create a new annotation that you will then reference in you document:

1.	Go to the notes & references section
  `[show picture of the different sections]`
2.	Similarly, to slices, you must add a new annotation by clicking on [Add a new annotation]

To create a new annotation, you must fill in the required fields on the annotation editor:

  `[Show annotation editing section]`

To be able to reference your annotation in your document, you must give your annotation a unique identifier in the `[Annotation identifier]` field. If your annotations are reference with numbers, you have the option of enforcing numerical order for your references by checking the `[Enforce nuerical order]`. This will only hide the `[Annotation identifier]` field and automatically assign a number in the order of appearance of the annotation.

There are two ways you can display the reference: Markdown or Bibtex. You can choose which you want to use by changing the `[content type]`

  `[show markdown reference example] | [show bibtex reference example]`

After adding a new annotation with all the necessary fields filled out, you can then reference that annotation in your document. The editor tells you how you can reference that annotation in the document:

  `[Show picture of editor showing]`

**Annotation reference inside a paragraph of text**

  `[Show annotation reference example]`

### Textual descriptions

Another way to annotate, is by adding textual descriptions. This is especially useful if you want to explain a graph, a table or any visual reference.

1.  Go to the slice in which you want to add a text description to
2.  Reveal the `[Textual Description tab]`
3.  Similar to slices, you can add a new textual description with its content in both English and French. Just click on the `[+]` sign.

If you wish to delete a textual description, simply click on the trash can on the left of it:

  `[show delete textual description]`

### Sources

Another way to annotate, is by adding your sources.

1.  Go to the slice in which you want to add a source to
2.  Reveal the [Sources tab]
3.  Similar to textual descriptions, you can add sources with its content in both English and French. Just click on the [+] sign.

If you wish to delete a source, simply click on the trash can on the left of it:

  `[show delete sources]`

### Notes

Another way to annotate, is by adding relevant notes.

1.  Go to the slice in which you want to add a source to
2.  Reveal the [Sources tab]
3.  Similar to textual descriptions, you can add sources with its content in both English and French. Just click on the [+] sign.

If you wish to delete a source, simply click on the trash can on the left of it.

  `[show delete notes]`
