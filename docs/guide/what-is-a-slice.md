# What is a slice

To enable the editor to correctly order the document's content and differentiate between the different types of content that may exist (tables, paragraphs, images, etc.), the PBOML visual editor defines each piece of content as a slice. Each slice type is characterized by the type of content it can display.

## Types of slices

There are currently seven types of slices that allow the PBOML editor to create any document you might need:

-	Rich Text (Markdown) Slice
-	Heading Slice
-	Key-Value list Slice
- Table Slice
- Chart Slice
-	SVG Vector Slice
-	Bitmap Slice

## English and French Content

Each slice represents a different type of content. However, if a slice contains text, that text must be represented in both English and French, regardless of the slice type. Here are some examples:

    [Show a ]
    [Insert BIL example in a chart]
