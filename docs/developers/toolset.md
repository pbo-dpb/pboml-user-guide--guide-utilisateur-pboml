# PBOML Toolset

The PBOML toolset contains a Web component that can transforms PBOML documents into interactive HTML. This component also includes a content editor that allows integrators to edit PBOML documents.

This Web component is the central component of the PBOML toolset. You can integrate it into your own Web application by following the [instructions available in readme of the GIT repository](https://github.com/pbo-dpb/pboml-parser--parseur-pboml/).

The PBOML toolset also includes a parser that transforms PBOML documents into PDF using Node.js and Puppetteer. This parser is still under development and currently only supports AWS Lambda.
