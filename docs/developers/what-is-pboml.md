# The PBOML project

PBOML is a language used to publish reports and analyses produced by the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer. It was designed to meet the specific requirements of an organization producing specialized publications under time and staffing constraints.

PBOML also designates the tools used to produce and publish documents in this language. These tools include a parser, a rendering engine, and a content editor.

## Target Users

PBOML is designed to be used by three levels of users: analysts, integrators, and web developers. Analysts use Microsoft Word to structure and format the content, while integrators can transform Word documents to PBOML through a graphical interface or directly in the source code. Web developers have advanced training and can manipulate entire documents based on the language documentation.

## Human and Machine Readable

PBOML allows for bulk changes to documents at publication time and the extraction of data from documents through scripting. It provides a balance between being machine-readable for automated processes and human-readable for easy editing.

## No Specific Software

PBOML can be used without the need for specialized software. Users only require a browser.

## Print and Web

PBOML supports both web and print media. It can produce a print-ready PDF as well as a Web version using the same source document.

## Varied Content

PBOML supports a variety of content types, including rich text, charts, and tables. It goes beyond simple markup languages like Markdown to provide a bilingual predefined structure for inserting and machine-reading data and metadata in documents.

## Content Variety

The nature of the OPBO's work requires a great variety of content in the published documents, including rich text, charts, and tables. While PBOML uses a simple markup language like Markdown for text slices, a predefined structure is necessary to insert and machine-read data and metadata in documents.

## Client Side

Most of the operations related to the PBOML production process are done on the client side, without using a server. The PBOML tools, including the parser, rendering engine, and content editor, are designed to be executed exclusively in a web browser. PDF generation can be done locally or through the use of a script running on a serverless cloud solution.

PBOML files are plain text files, making them compatible with information management software packages used in government institutions.
